Self Portrait Lab 

## Lesson 0.6 : MakeCode Arcade self-portrait
### Overview
Today, you will continue your exploration of MakeCode Arcade, creating a simple "self-portrait" program to introduce yourself to your instructors and classmates.
Learning objectives
* Students will be able to...
* Identify the major areas of the MakeCode Arcade programming environment.
* Manipulate objects in the MakeCode Arcade environment

Activity
	•	Open MakeCode Arcade on your computer.  The URL is https://arcade.makecode.com.
	•	Create a new project called Self-Portrait.
	•	Set a background color
	•	Create a new sprite that represents you
	•	Draw your sprite to represent yourself (don’t use an existing image from the Gallery)
	•	Make the sprite “say” several things about you, including:
	•	Your name and grade
	•	At least three things from your Do Now exercise
	•	“Goodbye!”
	•	Using the coordinate system, you learned in lesson 0.5, move the sprite to another place on the screen.
	•	If there is time left, you can add more actions to your program as you see fit! Here are some ideas:

Instead of just appearing in a different position on the screen, have the sprite move smoothly
Add a second sprite which also talks to the player.
Make the sprite only talk when the player hits a button.
	•	Submit your Self-Portrait using your instructor's directions. If you are having trouble downloading and saving your program, here is a great video to help you.
